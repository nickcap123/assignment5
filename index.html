    <p>He is known for his work in the pop art movement. <strong>Pop art</strong> is an art movement that emerged in the United Kingdom and the United States during the <em>mid-late 1950's</em>. The movement presented a challenge to traditions of fine art by including imagery from popular and mass culture, such as advertising, comic books and mundane cultural objects. Pop artists created pictures of consumer product labels and packaging, photos of celebrities, comic strips, and animals.</p>
